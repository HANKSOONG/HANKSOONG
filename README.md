# 👋 Hi, I’m Hank Song

I'm a Master's student in AI, with a focus on **vision**, **multimodal fusion**, and **deep learning systems**. I enjoy building pipelines that *actually work* — whether that's benchmarking DINOv2 on CIFAR, restoring blurry images, or fusing human traits across video, text, and audio.
